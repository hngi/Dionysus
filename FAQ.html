          <div class="text-component">
            <p>It really is important to keep track of how you are spending your money. It is the first step to understanding how you are managing your money, and to taking control of your finances.

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>The real reason you track your expenses is to create financial awareness. If you don’t know where your money goes or how you spend it, you won’t know what habits you can change in order to make your money work for you. Even your small daily expenses can make you blow your budget. Those who become millionaires are aware of the money that they make and that they spend. True wealth is built as you spend less than you make and to do that you need to know what you are spending. If you want to build wealth, then you need to stop wasting money.</p></div>

            <p>Tracking your spending can help you identify serious spending issues. You can also see if your spending matched your priorities. It is easier to make changes when you realize that you are not reaching your financial goals because you eat out every night. Tracking your spending allows you to see where your money is really going. It is essential if you want to understand your financial habits and make changes to them. It can help you realize when you need to stop spending, so you do not end up with a financial hangover.</p></div>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>An easy way to track your expenses is to simply write down every penny that you spend and where you spent it in a notebook. You may want to make a page for each budget category or simply put the category next to the amount you spent. This gives you a quick look at where your money goes, although it may be more difficult to separate the money into categories or look at spending trends. It at least makes you more aware of where your money is going.</p></div>

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>When you overspend in a few categories, it can be tempting to stop and then try again next month. It is important to continue to track throughout the month so you can identify what you need to change and by how much. A budget is something that evolves over time to help you meet your needs and goals. Recognizing that you are overspending consistently in one area can help you know if you need to increase that category and cut in other areas.</p></div>
